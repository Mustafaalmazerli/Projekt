##Project Overview


In today's digitalized society, automated data handling and analysis are crucial for informed decision-making, particularly in areas like public safety and crime prevention. This project aims to streamline the collection of crime data from the police's API, structure it in a SQL database, and then analyze the data to generate automated news articles about crime events. Additionally, this structured data is visualized using Power BI to highlight crime trends and provide actionable insights.

#The core objectives of this project are:

Automate Data Collection: Collect data from the police's API in real-time and store it in a structured SQL database for further analysis.
Generate News Articles: Develop a machine learning model that uses the collected crime data to automatically generate coherent news articles.
Visualize Crime Trends: Utilize Power BI to create visual representations of crime data, providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of trends and enabling data-driven decisions.
